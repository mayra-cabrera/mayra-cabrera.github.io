Inspired by the idea of [Thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), I'm starting a repository about small & new things that I'm learning on a daily basis. [Check it out](https://github.com/mayra-cabrera/til), mostly is about ruby tips that I've recently learned, but I hope to put together a lot more, and for different categories also (rails, js, angular, git, etc..), feel free to contribute :)
