You probably had heard about `instance_eval` which evaluates a block in the context of an object:


    class MyHappyClass
      def initialize
        @a = 1
      end
    end

    obj = MyHappy.new
      obj.instance_eval do
        @a # => 1
      end
    end

The block is evaluated with the receiver as self, so it can access the receiverâ€™s private methods and instance variables, such as @v. Well 
`instance_eval` has a slightly more flexible twin brother named `instance_exec` that allows us to pass arguments to the block. See the following example:


    class A
      def initialize
        @b = 1
      end
    end


    class B
      def weird_behaviour
        @c = 1
        A.new.instance_eval{"@b: #{@b}, @c: #{@c}"}
      end
    end

    

What do you think is going to print `weird_behaviour`? You might think that the block in B#weird_behaviour can access both the `@b` instance variable con `A`class and the `@c`instance variable from B, but nope :(. 

    B.new.weird_behaviour # => "@b: 1, @c: "


When it tries to print `@c` instance variable is going to print an empty space, why? because of this: since instance variables depend on self, when `instance_eval` switches `self` to the receiver, all the instances variables in the caller fall out of scopes, this means the code inside the block interprets `@c` as a instance variable of `A` (and because it wasn't initialized that means is nil and prints out an empty string!)

This is where `instance_exec` comes to the rescue! We can use it to merge `@b` and `@c` in the same scope like this: 


    class B
      def weird_behaviour
        @c = 1
        A.new.instance_exec(@c){|c| "@b: #{@b}, @c: #{@c}"}
      end
    end

    B.new.weird_behaviour # => "@b: 1, @c: 1"

I don't know a real example of how use `instance_exec` can be useful, but hey doesn't hurt to know more huh? :)
